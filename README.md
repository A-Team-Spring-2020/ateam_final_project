#### Project Description: 
This project displays statistics related to coronavirus to provide a better understanding of how the virus is affecting people across America. The default display will show the various hotspots in America with the highest amount of coronavirus cases. The features on the side-bars (see GUI sketch below) will let the user customize how they see the data.

The user can choose between various modes to display the data (map, table, graph), as well as select which portions of data are shown with the ability to filter by timeframe and location.

The user can also extrapolate the data into the future and save the result to a CSV file.

Data will be downloaded in CSV format from the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE [(link to data)](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

We hope you like it!

#### Future Work:
One feature we'd like to implement in the future is a suggestion and auto-complete capability when users enter the name of a city/state/country. We'd like to have it such that as the user enters the first few letters, several potential names come up -- similar to auto-complete in a search engine, for example. 

Additionally, we'd like it to be able to extrapolate future predictions for COVID-19 cases. This would require a great deal of analytics and statistics, but the ability to see how the cases could trend would enrich the program.
