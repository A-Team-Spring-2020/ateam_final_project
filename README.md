#### Project Description: 
* This project displays statistics related to coronavirus to provide a better understanding of how the virus is affecting people across America. The default display will show the various hotspots in America with the highest amount of coronavirus cases. The features on the side-bars (see GUI sketch below) will let the user customize how they see the data. 
* The user can choose between various modes to display the data (map, table, graph), as well as select which portions of data are shown with the ability to filter by timeframe and location.
* The user can also extrapolate the data into the future and save the result to a CSV file.
* Data will be downloaded in CSV format from the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE [(link to data)](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).
